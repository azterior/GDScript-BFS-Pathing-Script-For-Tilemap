# GDScript-BFS-Pathing-Script-For-Tilemap

An Algorithm for Godot, primarily written by Nico that searches a tilemap for every tiles relative distance to a chosen point accounting for weight values assigned to the tiles. This is a simplified form of Dijkstras without the A to B pathbuilding functionality as this is meant to be used in tandem with the native AStar node.
